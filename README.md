## **Dev Camper API**

- Authentication/ Authorization
- Express Middleware
- CRUD Routes
- Mongoose Aggregation Functions

API is largely RPC. GraphQL is a good way to go here since I just need the db over http for the most part. Getting an Apollo Server set up is next in the pipeline.

> Update: Apollo Server done [here](https://github.com/ritwikvd/dev-camper-graphql-api)
